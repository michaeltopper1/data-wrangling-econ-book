# Welcome {#welcome}

This book is designed to go with the UCSB graduate economics course Econ 245: Data Wrangling for Economists.


## Organization

The book's organization was designed to help the second-year PhD student get ready to do research as soon as possible. There is focus on both organization and coding techniques. In later updates, we hope to add in some more advanced topics that are covered in the course such as PDF extracting, webscraping, estimation, making a package, publication tables, and spatial data. The book was made with a `tidyverse` focus.
