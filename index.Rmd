# Welcome {#welcome}

This book is designed to go with the UCSB course Econ 245: Data Wrangling for Economists. The book is still a work in progress and will be updated regularly.

In the following chapters, you will practice data wrangling with some hand-holding as well as some simple exercises to check your understanding. The purpose of these chapters is the following:

1. Make your homework easier.
2. Make you a better coder by observing good code.
3. Get hands-on practice with functions you will need to complete your assignments.
4. Provide a reference for each topic in the course.


It is *strongly* suggested that you code along with the examples that we go through, although there will be times when copying and pasting can be useful (e.g., loading in a data set).
